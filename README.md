# CPE301
The purpose of this project was to design a system, using Arduino, which allows people to wash 
their hands, using guidelines like using warm water, and washing for at least 30 seconds. The 
hardware involved was a Servo Motor, ultrasonic sensor, a DHT temperature sensor, a fan, and a 
LCD screen. These devices are programmed together using a primary use case function and 
alternate flows.
